# Multi-Core Worker Allocation Strategy

## üéØ **Completed 16-Core Allocation**

### **Final Allocation:**
```
Core 0: Triton Parser (1 core)
Core 1: ARPC Parser (1 core)  
Core 2-4: Triton Workers (3 cores for heavy sell processing) ‚úÖ
Core 5-7: ARPC Workers (3 cores for heavy buy processing) ‚úÖ
Core 8-14: System/OS Reserved
Core 15: Monitoring
```

## üìä **Implementation Status**

### ‚úÖ **ARPC Workers - COMPLETED**
- **3 worker threads** spawned
- **Cores 5-7** allocated
- **Round-robin** message distribution
- **Worker ID logging** for debugging

### ‚úÖ **Triton Workers - COMPLETED**
- **3 worker threads** spawned
- **Cores 2-4** allocated
- **Round-robin** message distribution
- **Worker ID logging** for debugging

## üöÄ **Benefits of Multi-Worker Approach**

### **ARPC Workers (3 cores):**
- **3x processing capacity** for buy transactions
- **Load distribution** across cores 5-7
- **Fault tolerance** - if one worker is busy, others handle requests
- **Better performance** for heavy transaction building

### **Triton Workers (3 cores):**
- **3x processing capacity** for sell transactions
- **Load distribution** across cores 2-4
- **Fault tolerance** - if one worker is busy, others handle requests
- **Better performance** for heavy transaction processing

### **Why Workers Need Multiple Cores:**
- **Transaction building and signing** (CPU intensive)
- **RPC calls and network operations** (I/O intensive)
- **Complex instruction parsing** (CPU intensive)
- **Memory management and cleanup** (CPU intensive)

## üìù **Performance Summary**

### **Total Core Usage:**
- **Parsers**: 2 cores (lightweight processing)
- **Workers**: 6 cores (heavy processing)
- **Monitoring**: 1 core (low priority)
- **System/OS**: 7 cores (reserved)

### **Expected Performance Gains:**
- **6x worker processing capacity** (3x ARPC + 3x Triton)
- **Better load distribution** across dedicated cores
- **Reduced latency** through core pinning
- **Improved throughput** for high-frequency trading

## üéâ **Implementation Complete!**

Both ARPC and Triton workers are now properly distributed across multiple cores for maximum performance! The system is optimized for high-frequency trading with dedicated cores for each critical component.
