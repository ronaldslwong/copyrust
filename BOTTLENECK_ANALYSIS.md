# 🔍 Bottleneck Analysis & Solutions

## 📊 **Current Performance Issues**

### **🚨 Critical Bottlenecks Identified:**

#### **1. ARPC Processing Rate: 77.78%**
```
ARPC: Received=27, Processed=21, Rate=77.78%
```
- **6 messages dropped** (27 received, 21 processed)
- **Root Cause**: Not all transactions contain target program IDs
- **Status**: ✅ **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR** - This is normal filtering

#### **2. Worker Processing Rate: 9.5%**
```
WORKER: Received=21, Built=2, Inserted=2
```
- **19 out of 21 messages not built** (90.5% failure rate)
- **Root Cause**: Strict instruction pattern matching
- **Status**: 🔧 **NEEDS INVESTIGATION** - This is the main issue

#### **3. Triton Processing Issues**
```
TRITON: Received=2, Sent=1, Found=0, Errors=1
```
- **0 transactions found** in the map
- **50% error rate**
- **Root Cause**: No transactions being built by workers
- **Status**: 🔧 **DEPENDENT ON WORKER FIX**

## 🔧 **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Worker Logging**
- **Added detailed instruction matching logs**
- **Shows program IDs being checked**
- **Logs instruction data mismatches**
- **Provides transaction summary when no matches found**

### **2. Enhanced ARPC Parser Logging**
- **Shows which target programs are detected**
- **Logs why transactions are processed or skipped**
- **Provides visibility into filtering decisions**

### **3. Multi-Worker Implementation**
- **3 ARPC workers** on cores 5-7
- **3 Triton workers** on cores 2-4
- **Improved parallel processing capacity**

## 🎯 **Expected Improvements**

### **After Enhanced Logging:**
1. **Identify specific instruction patterns** that aren't matching
2. **See which programs** are being detected vs ignored
3. **Understand why transactions** aren't being built
4. **Optimize instruction matching** logic

### **Performance Targets:**
- **ARPC Processing**: 77.78% → 85%+ (realistic target)
- **Worker Processing**: 9.5% → 60%+ (main goal)
- **Triton Processing**: 0% → 80%+ (dependent on worker fix)

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### **1. Run with Enhanced Logging**
```bash
cargo run --bin copy_rust
```

### **2. Analyze Logs for:**
- **Which instruction patterns** are failing to match
- **What program IDs** are being detected
- **Why transactions** aren't being built
- **Instruction data mismatches**

### **3. Optimize Based on Findings:**
- **Adjust instruction discriminators**
- **Add more program support**
- **Relax matching criteria** if needed
- **Add fallback logic**

## 🔍 **Monitoring Commands**

### **Check Current Stats:**
```rust
// In your code
let (received, processed, errors) = get_arpc_stats();
let (worker_received, worker_built, worker_inserted, worker_errors) = get_worker_stats();
```

### **Debug Map Contents:**
```rust
let (map_size, entries) = get_map_stats();
println!("Map size: {}, entries: {:?}", map_size, entries);
```

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Target Performance:**
- **ARPC Processing Rate**: >85%
- **Worker Build Rate**: >60%
- **Triton Success Rate**: >80%
- **Overall Success Rate**: >90%

### **Key Indicators:**
- **Worker logs** showing successful instruction matches
- **Map entries** being populated
- **Triton workers** finding transactions to sell
- **Reduced error rates** across all components
