# Performance Optimization: Logging Feature Flag

## Problem
The profiling data showed a significant 13.2µs delay from the "Log event" operation in the ARPC parser:

```
[PROFILE][58RJ5dS3aouZmhjwd5B3LoDPJj3A4JqvFJKFoKunAqyuBCGLbzYqjey4jK34Yyp9VZqTMeCjyycfoXnxmSce36Gg] Log event: 13.19µs
```

This delay was caused by:
1. Creating an `Event` struct with a `Vec<u8>` copy of the signature
2. Sending it through a channel to an async task that processes logging
3. The channel send operation and struct creation overhead

## Solution
Added a `verbose_logging` feature flag to conditionally disable logging operations:

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `src/utils/logger.rs`:**
   - Wrapped `log_event()` function with `#[cfg(feature = "verbose_logging")]`
   - Wrapped `setup_event_logger()` function with `#[cfg(feature = "verbose_logging")]`

2. **Modified `src/grpc/arpc_parser.rs`:**
   - Added `#[cfg(feature = "verbose_logging")]` to all profiling print statements

3. **Fixed existing feature flags:**
   - Replaced `verbose_profiling` with `verbose_logging` in all files

## Performance Impact

### With `verbose_logging` feature enabled:
- Full logging functionality available
- 13.2µs delay per transaction from logging operations
- Useful for debugging and development

### With `verbose_logging` feature disabled (default):
- **Zero logging overhead** - all logging operations are completely eliminated at compile time
- **13.2µs performance improvement** per transaction
- **No runtime cost** for logging infrastructure

## Usage

### To build with logging enabled:
```bash
cargo build --features verbose_logging
```

### To build with logging disabled (default):
```bash
cargo build
```

### To run with logging enabled:
```bash
cargo run --features verbose_logging
```

### To run with logging disabled (default):
```bash
cargo run
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero-cost abstraction**: When the feature is disabled, all logging code is completely eliminated at compile time
2. **Performance improvement**: Eliminates 13.2µs per transaction processing
3. **Flexible**: Can be enabled for debugging without code changes
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Expected Performance Improvement

Based on the profiling data:
- **Before**: 22.88µs total parser time
- **After**: ~9.68µs total parser time (22.88µs - 13.2µs)
- **Improvement**: ~57% reduction in parser overhead

This optimization is particularly valuable for high-frequency trading applications where every microsecond counts.
